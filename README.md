# find_hamilton_paths_multi-threading
A simple project to exploit parallelism in the techniques which are used to find Hamilton (Hamiltonian) paths
 

There were some restrictions while coding this project (so that i can learn more)
* Design and implement your own data structure
* try to avoid use of inbuilt/third-party libraries

That is why you may see some implementations of the classes like ArrayList and ThreadPool. However, you can modify code
and use inbuilt libs.

Thanks !!!
